Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from vehicles are a major contributor to climate change.
Governments and organizations around the world are working to reduce emissions by promoting
the use of cleaner vehicles. One way to encourage the adoption of cleaner vehicles is by providing
consumers with information on the environmental impact of their vehicle choices. This project
aims to develop a machine learning-based system that can predict the CO2 emissions of vehicles
based on their features. The system will be trained on a dataset of vehicle features such as number
of cylinders, transmission type, fuel type and fuel consumption in city, highway and combined
scenarios. The goal of the project is to develop a system that can accurately predict CO2 emissions
for new vehicles, helping consumers make more informed decisions about their vehicle choices.
The system can also be used by policymakers and manufacturers to assess the environmental
impact of several types of vehicles and make informed decisions about future vehicle development.
The developed system will help reduce CO2 emissions from vehicles and mitigate the effects of
climate change.
